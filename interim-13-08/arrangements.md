## HTTPbis Working Group Interim Meeting - August 2013

This is the arrangements page for the [HTTPbis Working
Group](http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki)'s third Interim
Face-to-Face meeting, hosted by Adobe in Hamburg.

### Register

Interim meetings are primarily for active participants in the work; therefore,
if there are more registrants than space allows, preference may be given
to those who have taken part in mailing list discussion. If you have not yet
been active on the mailing list, but will be doing so going forward, let us
know that, to help make this decision.

If you only wish to observe the meeting, please denote that in your
registration; we usually have additional seating that isn't "at the table", but
is suitable for observing, and this helps us manage space constraints.

Likewise, the purpose of interim meetings is for stakeholders to work towards
consensus on key points. Therefore, if any one company, project or concern is
over-represented in registrations, they may be asked to withdraw participants
(or denote them as observers) to assure balanced representation.

Remote participation facilities might be available; if you're interested, 
please indicate this.

To register, please e-mail [Mark Nottingham](mailto:mnot@mnot.net) by 28 June.

### Schedule and Agenda

We'll be meeting Monday 5 August, Tuesday 6 August and a half-day on Wednesday
7 August (finishing by 1pm).

A separate agenda will be published, but discussions will focus on the
[HTTP/2.0 specification](http://http2.github.io/http2-spec/) and [related
issues](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/issues).
