## HTTPbis Working Group Interim Meeting - August 2013

This is the arrangements page for the [HTTPbis Working
Group](http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki)'s third Interim
Face-to-Face meeting, hosted by Adobe in Hamburg.

### Register

The goal of this interim meeting is issue resolution through highly active
participation. Try as we might, the meeting space we could secure is more
limited in size than the usual IETF meeting venues. Because of this, we ask you
to use your judgment and only register up if you have been actively
participating in work on the mailing list or in other face-to-face meetings, or
if you intend to do so in this meeting.

If you are planning to mostly observe, consider whether other colleagues who
will be actively participating can represent your views in the room.

We will make every effort to accommodate those who let us know they plan to be
active participants. Others are welcome to tell us they will be less active or
want to observe, and we will do our best to accommodate you in the available
space.

We will do our best to provide remote participation facilities; please let us
know if you are interested in using them.

To register, please e-mail [Mark Nottingham](mailto:mnot@mnot.net) by 28 June.

### Schedule and Agenda

We'll be meeting Monday 5 August, Tuesday 6 August and a half-day on Wednesday
7 August (finishing by 1pm).

A separate agenda will be published, but discussions will focus on the
[HTTP/2.0 specification](http://http2.github.io/http2-spec/) and [related
issues](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/issues).
