## HTTPbis Working Group Interim Meeting - October 2013

This is the arrangements page for the [HTTPbis Working
Group](http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki)'s fourth Interim
Face-to-Face meeting, hosted by Microsoft Open Technologies (with participation from Microsoft product groups) in Bellevue, WA USA.

### Register

The goal of this interim meeting is interoperability testing and issue
resolution. Therefore, we encourage those who are participating in these
activities to register.

In particular, we especially encourage those who are involved with testing
HTTP/2 implementations to attend, as we'll have a testing and interop day on
Wednesday.

Those who wish to observe the meeting may also register, but we ask you to use
your judgement in doing so. In particular, if you are planning to observe,
consider whether other colleagues who will be actively participating can
represent your views. If we become constrained by available space, observers
may be asked to sit at the edge of the room.

If you wish to participate remotely, please indicate this in your registration.

If you only plan to attend for part of the interim, please indicate that when
you register.

To register, please e-mail [Mark Nottingham](mailto:mnot@mnot.net) by 20
September.

begin at 9AM each day, and end at approximately 5pm on Wednesday and Thursday.

A separate agenda will be published, but tentatively:
* Wednesday will be an interop / testing day

  [issue](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/issues) discussion (including
