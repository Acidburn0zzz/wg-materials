    <h1>IETF 78 - HTTPbis vs Content-Disposition</h1>

    </p>
  
    <h2 class="break">Problem Statement (1/2)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>RFC2616 includes "Content-Disposition" (<a href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.19.5.1">RFC 2616, Section 19.5.1)</a>,
      but also says:
      <br />
      <q>RFC 1806 [35], from which the often implemented Content-Disposition (see Appendix 19.5.1) header field in HTTP is derived, has a number of very serious security considerations. Content-Disposition is not part of the HTTP standard, but since it is widely implemented, we are documenting its use and risks for implementers.</q>
      (<a href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.15.5">RFC2616, Section 15.5</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Refers to RFC 1806 (definition of Content-Disposition), obsoleted by RFC 2183.
      </li> 
      <li>
        I18N for Content-Disposition (filename) relies on on MIME specs RFC 2047, augmented RFC 2184,
        which itself was obsoleted by RFC 2231 ('MIME Parameter Value and Encoded Word Extensions: Character Sets, Languages, and Continuations').
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="break">Problem Statement (2/2)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>RFC 2183 did not state that it obsoleted RFC 1806, making it hard to find the 
      up-to-date spec (fixed in RFC Index in the meantime)</li>
      <li>RFC 2231 specifies many features that are not needed in HTTP, but also
      fails to REQUIRE common character sets for interoperability</li>
      <li>Interoperability suffers from all of this, see test cases at
      <a href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/">http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/</a> --
      Firefox, Konqueror and Opera are fine, the other UAs do not support the I18N extensions
      defined in RFC 2231.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="break">Broken Record Warning</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, you have seen this before, but there is progress being made!
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="break">Current Status</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Profile RFC 2231 for use in HTTP (remove ambiguities, fix grammar,
        remove unneeded features, require a common character set:
        <a href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http-12.html">draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http-12</a>).
        <br/>
        <small>(Note: does not normatively refer to RFC 2231 so it can evolve independently)</small>
        <br/>
        <em><b>Approved by IESG on the Standards Track in April, to be published as RFC very soon.</b></em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Profile makes it easier for new HTTP header field definitions to "opt in"
        (HTTP Link Header field / Web Linking specification, also in the RFC Editor queue, does this)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="break">Work Left To Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove from HTTPbis (discussed during IETF-72 in Dublin)</li>
      <li>Move actual definition of Content-Disposition as HTTP header field into
      a separate specification (work has started with
      <a href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-rfc2183-in-http-00.html">draft-reschke-rfc2183-in-http-00</a>)
      <br />
      <em><b>Volunteers for helping this getting done appreciated.</b></em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Mention the profile in a yet to be written section about defining new
        HTTP headers.
