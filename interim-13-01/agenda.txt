HTTP/2 Draft Status
-------------------

The editors (Alexey and Martin) will summarise their current status and
plans for editorial work. 


HTTP/2 Issues
-------------

### Upgrade

We've delegated TLS upgrade to the TLSWG, and have a plan of action for 
HTTP to use the Upgrade mechanism defined by HTTP/1.1, possibly augmented
by hints in DNS and response headers. 

We currently have a proposal for the details of the upgrade, as well as a
DNS hint proposal. Discussion will focus around these.

### Header Compression

SPDY3's header compression has an identified security issue, so we've 
been evaluating potential alternatives. Discussion will centre around the
specifics of these proposals, the criteria we'll use for selecting one, and
the general approach that HTTP/2 takes to header compression.

### Flow Control

We'll discuss Gabriel's draft of general principles for flow control, and
how best to reflect it in the draft.

### Frame Sizes

SDPY3 has a data frame with a maximum size of 16MB. Some implementers have 
mentioned that this limits the use of sendfile() with large files; we'll
discuss whether to include a "jumbo" frame size (as well as other sizes, 
depending on their use cases).


### Prioritisation

We'll start discussion of the prioritisation mechanism, with the aim of 
identifying specific issues and/or changes to make.

### Other Issues and Deliverables

Discussion of other potential issues (editorial or design), additional
deliverables, etc.


Implementation and Testing
--------------------------

Based upon the progress we make (or fail to), we'll attempt to sketch out
a plan for proofs-of-concept, implementation and interoperability testing.
