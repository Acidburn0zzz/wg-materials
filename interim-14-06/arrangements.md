### Transportation

New York is served by three major airports:
  * [JFK](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk.html) is John F. Kennedy International Airport, 
  * [LGA](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/laguardia.html) is LaGuardia Airport, also in Queens.
  * [EWR](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/newark-liberty.html) is Newark Liberty International Airport, across the river in Newark.

Depending on which airport you arrive at, there are a number of ways into the
city:

* [PATH](http://www.panynj.gov/path/) is the quickest, easiest way into the city from Newark. The 14th Street stop is a short distance from the venue.
* [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/new-york) has a flat rate from EWR for as little as US$65, and is available from other airports.
* Taxis serve all airports, and there is a [fixed fare to JFK](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml).

New York has an extensive [subway network](http://www.mta.info/nyct/subway/)
that is usually the best way to get around, whether you're traveling within
Manhattan or out to the other boroughs (including the airports in Queens.
You'll need to have a [Metrocard](http://web.mta.info/metrocard/) to travel.

Google's offices are directly outside the 14th Street station on the A, C and E
lines, and many others are nearby.
