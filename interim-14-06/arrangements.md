### Register

The goal of this interim meeting is interoperability testing and issue
resolution. Therefore, we encourage those who are participating in these
activities to register.

In particular, we especially encourage those who are involved with testing
HTTP/2 implementations to attend, as we'll have a testing and interop day on
Wednesday.

Those who wish to observe the meeting may also register, but we ask you to use
your judgement in doing so. In particular, if you are planning to observe,
consider whether other colleagues who will be actively participating can
represent your views. If we become constrained by available space, observers
may be asked to sit at the edge of the room.

If you wish to participate remotely, please indicate this in your registration.

If you only plan to attend for part of the interim, please indicate that when
you register.

To register, please e-mail [Mark Nottingham](mailto:mnot@mnot.net) by 03 May.
Please indicate any dietary restrictions when you register.

### Transportation

New York is served by three major airports:
  * [JFK](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk.html) is John F. Kennedy International Airport, 
  * [LGA](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/laguardia.html) is LaGuardia Airport, also in Queens.
  * [EWR](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/newark-liberty.html) is Newark Liberty International Airport, across the river in Newark.

Depending on which airport you arrive at, there are a number of ways into the
city:

* [PATH](http://www.panynj.gov/path/) is the quickest, easiest way into the city from Newark. The 14th Street stop is a short distance from the venue.
* [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/new-york) has a flat rate from EWR for as little as US$65, and is available from other airports.
* Taxis serve all airports, and there is a [fixed fare to JFK](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml).

New York has an extensive [subway network](http://www.mta.info/nyct/subway/)
that is usually the best way to get around, whether you're traveling within
Manhattan or out to the other boroughs (including the airports in Queens.
You'll need to have a [Metrocard](http://web.mta.info/metrocard/) to travel.

Google's offices are directly outside the 14th Street station on the A, C and E
lines, and many others are nearby.
