### Register

The goal of this interim meeting is interoperability testing and issue
resolution. Therefore, we encourage those who are participating in these
activities to register.

In particular, we especially encourage those who are involved with testing
HTTP/2 implementations to attend, as we'll have a testing and interop day on
Wednesday.

Those who wish to observe the meeting may also register, but we ask you to use
your judgement in doing so. In particular, if you are planning to observe,
consider whether other colleagues who will be actively participating can
represent your views. If we become constrained by available space, observers
may be asked to sit at the edge of the room.

If you wish to participate remotely, please indicate this in your registration.

If you only plan to attend for part of the interim, please indicate that when
you register.

To register, please e-mail [Mark Nottingham](mailto:mnot@mnot.net) by 03
January.

We'll be meeting Wednesday 22 through Friday 24 January, 2014. Meetings will

We plan to finish by 1pm on Friday.

### Local Considerations

Zurich in January is likely to be [even colder than you
anticipate](http://weatherspark.com/averages/32414/1/Zurich-Kloten-Zurich-Switze
rland); please pack accordingly. For the unprepared, [there is a shopping mall](http://www.glatt.ch/)
within a short (although cold) walk from the venue.
