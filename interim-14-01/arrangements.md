### Transportation

The closest major airport is [ZRH](http://www.zurich-airport.com/). There are a
number of ways to get to the venue:

* Zurich Flughafen is well-connected by Switzerland's national rail operator, [SBB](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html). See the [Zurich rail map](http://www.zvv.ch/opencms/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Liniennetzplan_ganzer_Verbund_2013.pdf) (pdf) for an overview.
* [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/zurich) doesn't have a flat rate for their airport, but quotes a trip from the airport to the venue as approximately 32-41CHF.

Cisco's offices are a short walk from the Wallisellen or Glattzentrum train
stations. There are trains directly From Zurich Main Station to Wallisellen
that run frequently.

### Local Considerations

Zurich in January is likely to be [even colder than you
anticipate](http://weatherspark.com/averages/32414/1/Zurich-Kloten-Zurich-Switze
 rland); please pack accordingly. For the unprepared, [there is a shopping
mall](http://www.glatt.ch/) within a short (although cold) walk from the venue.
